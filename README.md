#Project Objective:
Develop a comprehensive and efficient system for recording and tracking patients' emergency room visits. The platform aims to provide accurate and timely reports for medical staff and administrators, thereby improving the overall management and analysis of emergency room visits to enhance patient care and optimize resource allocation.


##Patient-Emergency-Room-Visit-Report

Analyzed patient data to identify trends and patterns, improving data accessibility and understanding, and creating over 10 KPIs for analysis.
Developed key performance indicators such as wait time (35.86%), satisfaction score (5.47%), and percentage of gender-specific visits, leading to a significant improvement in the overall standard of emergency care.
Crafted a customized Power BI dashboard to leverage insightful data analysis, optimize emergency room operations, and enhance the quality of patient services.
